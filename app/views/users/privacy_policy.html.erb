      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

      <p>Zround instantly connects people everywhere to what’s most meaningful to them.</p>

      <p>This Privacy Policy describes how and when Zround collects, uses and shares your information when you use our Services. Zround receives your information through our various websites, SMS, APIs, email notifications, applications, buttons, widgets, ads, and commerce services (the "Services" or "Zround") and from our partners and other third parties. For example, you send us information when you use Zround from our website, post or receive information via SMS, or access Zround from an application such as Zround for iOS. When using any of our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. Irrespective of which country you reside in or supply information from, you authorize Zround to use your information in the United States and any other country where Zround operates.

      <h2>Additional Information:</h2>
      <p>You may provide us with profile information to make public, such as a short biography, your location, your website, or a picture. You may provide information to customize your account, such as a cell phone number for the delivery of SMS messages. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services or to market to you. You may use your account settings to unsubscribe from notifications from Zround. You may also unsubscribe by following the instructions contained within the notification or the instructions on our website. We may use your contact information to help others find your Zround account, including through third-party services and client applications. Your privacy settings control whether others can find you by your email address or cell phone number. You may choose to upload your address book so that we can help you find Zround users you know or help other Zround users find you. We may later make suggestions to you and other users on Zround based on imported address book contacts. You can delete your imported address book contacts from Zround at any time. If you email us, we may keep your message, email address and contact information to respond to your request. If you connect your Zround account to your account on another service in order to cross-post between Zround and that service, the other service may send us your registration or profile information on that service and other information that you authorize. This information enables cross-posting, helps us improve the Services, and is deleted from Zround within a few weeks of your disconnecting from Zround your account on the other service. Learn more here. Providing the additional information described in this section is entirely optional.

      <h2>Cookies:</h2>
      <p>Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as searching and looking at public user profiles. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk. Zround may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. However, some Services may not function properly if you disable cookies. Learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies here.

      <h2>Log Data:</h2>
      <p>When you use our Services, we may receive information ("Log Data") such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device information (including device and application IDs), search terms, and cookie information. We receive Log Data when you interact with our Services, for example, when you visit our websites, sign into our Services, interact with our email notifications, use your Zround account to authenticate to a third-party website or application, or visit a third-party website that includes a Zround button or widget. We may also receive Log Data when you click on, view or interact with a link on our Services to a third-party application, such as when you choose to install another application through Zround. Zround uses Log Data to provide, understand, and improve our Services. If not already done earlier, for example, as provided below for Widget Data, we will either delete Log Data or remove any common account identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, or email address, after 18 months.

      <h2>Widget Data:</h2>
      <p>We may tailor the Services for you based on your visits to third-party websites that integrate Zround buttons or widgets. When these websites first load our buttons or widgets for display, we receive Log Data that includes the web page you visited and a cookie that identifies your browser ("Widget Data"). After a maximum of 10 days, we start the process of deleting, de-identifying, or aggregating Widget Data, which is usually instantaneous but in some cases may take up to a week. We may use Widget Data to tailor content for you, such as suggestions for people to follow on Zround and other content you may be interested in. Tailored content is stored with only browser cookies or device IDs and is separated from other Widget Data such as page-visit information. Learn more about the feature, including how you can suspend it or turn it off, here. For Flips, Log Data, and other information that we receive from interactions with Zround buttons or widgets, please see the other sections of this Privacy Policy.

      <h2>Commerce Services:</h2>
      <p>You may provide your payment information, including your credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address (collectively, "Payment Information"), along with your shipping address, to complete a commerce transaction on Zround. You may also provide your credit or debit card number to register for card-linked services, such as offers. To facilitate future purchases on Zround, we store your Payment Information, excluding CVV code, and shipping address, which you can remove from your account at any time using your account settings. We consider your Payment Information and shipping address private and do not make such information public. We collect and store information created by your purchases made on Zround ("Transaction Data"). If you register your credit or debit card with Zround for card-linked services, we receive information about the card transactions from a third-party payment services provider ("Registered Card Data"). Transaction Data and Registered Card Data may include the merchant’s name and the date, time and amount of the transaction. Zround uses Registered Card Data to verify eligibility for card-linked services, and may also use Registered Card Data to limit the number of offers available to you and keep track of your offers.

      <h2>Third-Parties and Affiliates:</h2>
      <p>Zround uses a variety of third-party services to help provide our Services, such as hosting our various blogs and wikis, and to help us understand and improve the use of our Services, such as Google Analytics. These third-party service providers may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP address. Third-party ad partners may share information with us, like a browser cookie ID, website URL visited, mobile device ID, or cryptographic hash of a common account identifier (such as an email address), to help us measure and tailor ads. For example, this allows us to display ads about things you may have already shown interest in. If you prefer, you can turn off tailored ads in your privacy settings so that your account is not matched to information shared by ad partners for tailoring ads. Learn more about your privacy options here and about how Zround ads work here. We may also receive information about you from our corporate affiliates in order to help provide, understand, and improve our Services and our affiliates’ services, including the delivery of ads.
